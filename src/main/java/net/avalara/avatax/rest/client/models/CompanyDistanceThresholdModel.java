/**
 * A company-distance-threshold model indicates the distance between a company
* and the taxing borders of various countries. Distance thresholds are necessary
* to correctly calculate some value-added taxes.
*  
* Distance thresholds only apply to sales of goods in certain countries. A distance threshold
* is applied for each ship-from/ship-to combination of countries. The threshold amount is defined by
* the ship-to country.
*  
* Generally, if you have exceeded a distance threshold for taxes between a pair of countries, your tax calculation
* will be determined to be the rate in the destination country. If you have not exceeded the threshold,
* your tax calculation will be determined to be the rate in the origin country.
*  
* The amount of a threshold is not tracked or managed in AvaTax, but the decision of your tax compliance department
* as to whether you have exceeded this threshold is maintained in this object.
*  
* By default, you are considered to have exceeded tax thresholds. If you wish to change this default, you can create
* a company-distance-threshold object to select the correct behavior for this origin/destination tax calculation process.
