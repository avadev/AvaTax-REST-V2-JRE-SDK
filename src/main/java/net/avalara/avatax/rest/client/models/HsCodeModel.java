/**
 * Describes an element in the harmonized tariff system.
*  
* According to the [United States International Trade Commission](https://www.usitc.gov), the harmonized tariff schedule is defined as follows:
*  
* The HTS is a U.S. nomenclature system used to classify traded goods based on their material composition, product name, and/or intended
* function. The HTS is designed so that each article falls into only one category. It is divided into chapters, each of which has a 2-digit
* number. Each product category within the various chapters is designated by 4, 6, 8, or 10 digits. The 4-digit categories are called
* "headings." The 6-, 8- and 10-digit classifications are called "subheadings."
*  
* Within AvaTax, the `HsCodeModel` object can refer to sections, chapters, headings, subheadings, or articles. Each object represents one
* classification. Many of these objects have child objects underneath them; these child objects are more specific than their parent objects.
 */
