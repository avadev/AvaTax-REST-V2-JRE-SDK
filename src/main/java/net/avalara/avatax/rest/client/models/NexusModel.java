/**
 * Represents a declaration of nexus within a particular taxing jurisdiction.
*  
* To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
* list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
* only the user-selectable fields in this object.
*  
* The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
* `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
*  
* When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
* must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
* by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.
